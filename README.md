# 2etime Game Engine
Hello, world!  Welcome to the 2etime Game Engine Repository.  Here you will find all of the source code from my past tutorials on youtube.

### Getting Started
In order to run the code, all you really need is x-code. Simply find the project you want to run and double click the .xcodeproj file.  This will open up the entire project, where you can view, edit, and hell even optimize the engine.

I have listed all of the project files from each episode of the tutorial at the bottom of this readme.

## Contributing
Since this is an ongoing tutorial series, it wouldn't really make sense for you to contribute to the episode files.  

However, if you use the engine to build out something badass... Feel free to add that to the Community folder, and submit a Pull Request.  If it is something really cool, I may even feature it in one of my tutorials :)
